### What it does

This bot listens for P25-encoded radio traffic and rebroadcasts
it over discord. This project what originally build for the
Ohio Wing Civil Air Patrol's Emergency Services, for squardons
with less funding would be able to still monitor radio traffic.

**This bot is not capable of transmitting.**
