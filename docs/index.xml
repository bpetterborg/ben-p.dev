      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction Getting Started Receiving [Decoding] What to do Next Additional Resources  Introduction NOAA has weather satellites that are easy to receive with basic and inexpensive equipment. This guide will show how to receive and decode the downlink of these satellites.
Roscosmos also operates METEOR satellites, which are relatively easy to receive and decode, which can be done with the same hardware, however this guide will not detail how to do this.</description>

      <description>Heads up This project is incomplete, while certain parts are functional, don&amp;rsquo;t expect it all to work. Content on this page may also change, as stuff is added and changed.
Table of Contents  Introduction Commands For Civil Air Patrol Members  What it does This bot listens for P25-encoded radio traffic and rebroadcasts it over discord. This project what originally build for the Ohio Wing Civil Air Patrol&amp;rsquo;s Emergency Services, for squardons with less funding would be able to still monitor radio traffic.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction Getting Started Prepare your environment Building your site  Introduction I had a bit of difficulty setting up Hugo to work with Github Pages, so I decided to document how I was able to make it work.
Getting Started This guide assumes you already have a Hugo site. If you do not, you can learn how to here.
You will also need a Github Pages repo setup, these are pretty simple, and you can use this guide.</description>
