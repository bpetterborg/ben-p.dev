      <description>Table of Contents  Introduction Getting Started Prepare your environment Building your site  Introduction I had a bit of difficulty setting up Hugo to work with Github Pages, so I decided to document how I was able to make it work.

You will also need a Github Pages repo setup, these are pretty simple, and you can use this guide.</description>
